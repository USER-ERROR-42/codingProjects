A few coding projects that I've done over the years

1. screepScripts:    the simple AI I wrote for the RTS game Screeps
2. spreadsheetToSQL: a java program that can take arbitary CSV files and creat SQL insert statements
3. cppUnderground:   a simple text adventure game I wrote for a beginner Java class
4. carFax:           a simple java program demonstrating how to use and access Apache Derby DB
